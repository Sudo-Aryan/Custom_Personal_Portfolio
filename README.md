# Custom_Personal_Portfolio

Hello there!!

My name is Aryan Halwai. I am a final year BE IT student, and today I have completed implementation/converting of Figma design to html,css and javascript.

MEDIA QUERIES have been extensively used in writing the css.

Also additional font-awesome icons have been used by importing its cdn.

The layout is fully responsive from 300px to 2000px.

With more such projects... Best
